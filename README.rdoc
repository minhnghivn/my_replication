== Introduction
MyReplication is an extention of the existing rails' mysql database adapter that is designed to help applications switch connection to another database server in a replication database system.

== Installation
    rails plugin install git@github.com:minhnghivn/my_replication.git

== Configuration
You need to specify a master database along with replicated ones in database.yml. For example:

      development:
        adapter: mysql
        database: masterdb
        pool: 5
        username: minhnghivn
        password: secret
        host: localhost
        replicas:
          - name: replica1
            database: db1
            username: minhnghivn
            password: secret
            host: localhost
          - name: replica2
            database: db2
            username: minhnghivn
            password: secret
            host: localhost

== Examples
Use "replication" block to allow switching connection (randomly) to one of the replicated databases (rather than the master one) then executing the statement inside the block

    User.replication do   
      list = User.all
    end

You can also explicitly specify the database connection with "using" block

    User.using(:replica1) do
      list = User.all
    end
